CN_Typical,CN_T_DP_004,MethodID_DataProcessing,"Final percent organic carbon and percent nitrogen were calculated using the instrument software based on peak area values from the thermal conductivity detector. Every 15 samples, a blank and two aspartic acid standards were ran. Samples were rerun if greater or less than 10 percent of the calibrated value. Analytical replicates were included every 15 samples and biological replicates (-1; -2; -3) were included every 10 samples. If the total organic carbon percentage was more than 1 percent three more biological replicates were ran. Samples with biological replicates are reported as the average value and a method deviation is included. Analytical replicates were only used for QAQC purposes and are not included in the provided data. For samples starting with ""SSS"": samples were rerun if the either the carbon or nitrogen analytical replicate coefficient of variation was greater than 15 percent. For samples starting with CM: samples were rerun if the carbon analytical replicate coefficient of variation was greater than 15 percent. For samples starting with ""CM"": nitrogen analytical replicate coefficient of variations ranged from 0 to 34 percent. Higher coefficient of variations in the CM samples may be a result of heterogenous parent material rather than a function of the method used. See Brodie et al. (2011) and Harris et al. (2001) for more information about methodologies. We also measured nitrogen percent on a subset of CM samples without fumigation and found no significant difference between these methodologies.",N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) – Richland
DP_Method_QA_QC,DTL_003,MethodID_DataProcessing,"Individual data cells contain a flag if the concentration measured was (1) negative; (2) outside of the standard curve; or (3) below the limit of detection (LOD). The text flag is formatted as ""[DataType]_[Below/Above]_[##]_ppm_[LOD/Standard]|[##]_ppm_Raw_Not_Corrected|[##]_ppm_Final_Corrected"". The ""|"" is used to allow the user to parse apart the three pieces of information. The first part of the text string indicates the reason for the flag and the value of the LOD or Standard. The second part indicates the raw data value without any correction. The third part indicates the final corrected value. This value could be corrected based on dilution or other corrections (see the alphanumeric codes at the top of the data column for more details). A text string such as ""NPOC_Above_30_ppm_Standard|30.1_ppm_Raw_Not_Corrected|415.2_ppm_Final_Corrected"" indicates that the NPOC value is above the 30 parts per million (ppm) standard (the highest standard used); the raw value was 30.1ppm; and the corrected value (due to dilution) is 415.2ppm. The raw not corrected and final corrected values could be the same if there was no dilution or other corrections needed. Negative concentration values are not reported; rather ""Negative_Value"" and ""-9999"" are included in the text string (e.g. ""NPOC_Below_0.5_ppm_LOD|Negative_Value_Raw_Not_Corrected|-9999_ppm_Final_Corrected"").

Medium sand was defined as sediment between 250 micrometers and 500 micrometers. Coarse sand was defined as sediment between 500 micrometers and 2000 micrometers (2 millimeters).

Moisture_Typical,MOIS_T_AN_002,MethodID_Analysis,Sediments were dried at 105 degC for at least two days or until mass was stable. After drying samples were placed in a desiccator until cool. Mass of dried sediment plus the weighing vessel was recorded.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) – Richland
Moisture_Typical,MOIS_T_DP_002,MethodID_DataProcessing,Gravimetric moisture was calculated as mass of wet sediment minus mass of the dry sediment divided by the mass of the dry sediment.

RATE_Method_QA_QC,RATE_000,MethodID_DataProcessing,A theoretical respiration rate was calculated and used in place of a measured value because the dissolved oxygen at time zero was lower than 5 milligrams per liter.

XRD_Typical,XRD_T_DP_000,MethodID_DataProcessing,Quantification of minerals was performed by the Rietveld method using TOPAS (v6; Bruker AXS). This method combines x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns from the substituent minerals calculated from their crystal structures to provide the best fit with the observed pattern. Because of the number of samples analyzed the refinements were performed semi-automatically for using the scripting language of Topas and selected results recorded in a text file. For each mineral the scale factor cell parameters (constrained within about 0.5 percent of the expected values) and crystallite size were refined. To avoid the peaks of weak minerals broadening excessively the minimum crystallite size was also constrained to be greater than 30 – 100 nanometers depending on the typical minimum values found for that mineral. Preferred orientation was observed for some minerals (mica; quartz; feldspar); and where this was evident a March-Dollase preferred orientation correction was also refined. The scale factors and unit cell contents from the Rietveld refinement were used to determine the relative quantities of the minerals which are presented scaled to a total of 100 percent.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) – Richland
