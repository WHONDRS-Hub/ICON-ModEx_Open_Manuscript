WHONDRS S19S Sediment Data Package

FTICR-MS data are split into two folders.

Data in "FieldSediment_Data" are from samples collected in the field, preserved, and analyzed.

Data in "IncubationConditionsSediment_Data" are from samples that represent the start of incubation conditions. The sediment was not actually incubated. The sediment was stored in the dark at 4 degrees C until it was ready for use. Then it was held in the dark at 21 degrees C overnight as if it was going to be incubated to measure respiration rates, but rather than following through with the incubation, it was flash frozen to preserve it until analysis. See the lab tracker metadata files for more detail.
