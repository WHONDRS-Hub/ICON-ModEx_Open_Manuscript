WHONDRS S19S Sediment Flow Cytometry Methods


Preparation (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) - 1 milliliter of sample was subsampled into three 2 milliliter cryovials. 

Preservation (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) - Samples were stored in the dark in 4 degC. 6 microliters of glutaraldahyde and 700 microliters of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added. The samples were then vortexed at power 3 for 5 seconds. After 10 minutes of incubating, samples were flash frozen. 

Storage (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) - Samples were stored at -80 degC and shipped on dry ice. 

Storage (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) - Samples were stored at -80 degC and shipped on dry ice. 

Analysis (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) - Upon sample processing, samples were thawed at 37 degC. Calibration beads were prepared by sonicating in bead stock solution for 10 minutes. 
The bead calibration working solution was prepared by adding 1 microliter of stock solution to 10 milliliters of double distilled water (DDW). 
Then 1 microliter of working solution was used per 1 milliliter of sample. For total bacteria, samples were stained with Sybr green solution. For phototrophs, samples were not stained. 
The working solution was made with 1 microliter of Sybr green stock solution and 100 microliter of DDW. 10 microliter of the working solution was used per 1 milliliter of sample. 
Samples were then vortexed and incubated for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature. 
After incubating, 250 microliters of sample per well was prepared in a 96 well plate. 
2.5 microliters of Sybr green working solution was added to each well and mixed into the sample by pipetting slowly several times.

Data Processing (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev) - Total heterotrophs was calculated by subtracting total phototrophs from total bacteria count.
