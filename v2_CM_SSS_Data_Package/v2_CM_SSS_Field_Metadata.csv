We couldn't remove the tip from the capsule in order to add the RNA later to the filter. We opted instead to cap/tape the bottom of a new filter; added the RNA later; and capped the top. This was the best we could modify on the fly to still get the sample for the capsule filter; we're hoping the electrical tape holds the cap in place. Both the labeled (but unpreserved) and unlabeled capsule filters are in the same whirlpack bag. It was cold. Light rain overnight; less than 0.5 in accumulation. We are in a pretty severe drought in parts of the watershed. The River is running really low (~1100 cubic feed per second; which is about the minimum).

","Site weather = Sunny; 22C. I provided a diagram (sketch) of the site with estimated distances in the uploaded files section in this form. The bank was level with fine and course sediments - if vegetation was present it was grasses on the bank (grasses appeared to be some Phragmites sp. and/or Paspalum denticulate). There was a steep incline up to a terrace (but it was not more than 4 meters long) and the terrace was vegetated with hardwoods (dominated by Platanus occidentalis). Most importantly; there was a dry; ephemeral tributary at the ""real"" bank (see sensor notes)nearest to area we sampled. There was evidence of erosional deposition present. The source of the ravine/tributary was a bare/muddy watering area of a densely populated cattle ranch. The river sediment was so fine that getting it through the filters was incredibly difficult (especially when using a 50 milliliter syringe) and therefore we used many filters. It would have been easier to use smaller syringes; but trying to fill a 500 milliliter bottle with a small syringe would have been tedious). Therefore the ""filtered water"" sample (BWT - filtered) had to be filled with non-filtered water. We managed to fill it to nearly 150 milliliter of filtered water; but it took 30 mins and we couldn't do that 3-4 more times. Therefore; we filled the remaining 400 milliliters with unfiltered water. Unfiltered noted on bottle. The unfiltered bottle (BWT) is only 50 percent filled due to the cap not being screwed on enough during transport to lab. All vials and bottles were individually wrapped and so the water did not contaminate other samples in the cooler. ",https://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=fwd&gage=hibt2&hydro_type=0
