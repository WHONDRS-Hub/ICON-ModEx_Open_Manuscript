If needed; 5 - 20 milliliters of 30 percent hydrogen peroxide was added to samples with 25 milliliters of Milli-Q water before adding sodium hexametaphosphate to remove organic matter.

GRN_Typical,GRN_T_DP_001,MethodID_DataProcessing,Fine sand was defined as sediment between 53 micrometers and 250 micrometers. Medium sand was defined as sediment between 250 micrometers and 500 micrometers. Coarse sand was defined as sediment between 500 micrometers and 2000 micrometers (2 millimeters). Percent fine; medium; and coarse sand were calculated by dividing the respective weight by the total dry weight. Percent clay was calculated from equations taken from Gee & Bauder 1986 in Methods of Soil Analysis; Part I; Physical and Mineralogical Methods using hydrometer readings at 1.5 hours (90 minutes) and 24 hours (1440 minutes). Negative clay values calculated by the script were considered below detection limit and reported as zero percent clay. When clay plus sand were greater than 100 percent; clay was adjusted so that the total percentage was 100 percent. Percent silt was calculated as percent sand minus percent clay. ,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) - Richland

INC_Typical,INC_T_AN_000,MethodID_Analysis,Time series measurements of the incubation were taken on a Fibox 3 to measure dissolved oxygen in a nondestructive manner.

INC_Typical,INC_T_DP_000,MethodID_DataProcessing,Respiration rates were calculated as the slope of the linear regression between dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements and incubation time. Points were removed from the regression for the following two reasons: 1) DO at time zero (the beginning of the incubation) was removed from the regression if the concentration was above the 1 milligram_per_liter above the threshold of expected DO concentration for 100 percent saturation at the experimental temperature and pressure. 2) If the regression does not seem to have a linear relationship (R-Squared value below 0.99) then points are removed from the end of the regression line (end of the time series) until the R-Squared value stops increasing or the total number of points reaches four. Note that points are removed only if the R-Squared value goes up after removing. If it goes down then the point is not removed.,N/A,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) – Richland
