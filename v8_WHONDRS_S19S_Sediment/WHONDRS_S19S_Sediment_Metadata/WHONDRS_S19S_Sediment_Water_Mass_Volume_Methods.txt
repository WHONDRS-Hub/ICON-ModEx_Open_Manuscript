WHONDRS S19S Sediment Water Mass Volume methods.

Storage - Sediment and water samples were kept in a temperature controlled chamber set at 21 deg C before incubations. Following incubations, combined sediment and water samples were kept at room temperature.

Preservation - No additional preserveration performed.

Preparation - Upon arrival, sediment was subsampled into pre-weighed 40 milliliter glass vial with an oxygen sensor spot. 

Inspection - Vials were intact and filled to appropriate levels.

Analysis - The mass of the 40 milliliter glass vial with an oxygen sensor spot and sediment was recorded and a breathe-easy membrane was added to the vial opening. Samples were then kept in an temperature controlled chamber set at 21 deg C overnight until analysis. The following day unfiltered water from the same sample site was added to the vial until there was no headspace. Following incubation, 2 milliters of slurry from the 40 milliliter glass vials with an oxygen sensor spot, sediment, and unfiltered water were subsampled before reweighing the samples. 

Data Processing - The wet mass of sediment in grams was calculated as the mass of wet sediment and 40 milliliter glass vial mius the mass of the 40 milliliter glass vial. The mass of water in grams in the 40 milliliter glass vials was calculated as the mass of the 40 milliliter glass vial with sediment and water minus the mass of the 40 milliter vial and the mass of wet sediment plus the approximately 2 grams removed for iron subsampling. 10 milliliters of sediment was added to each 40 milliliter vial.

Data flags:
For the following list of samples the mass of 40 milliter vial with wet sediment and mass of 40 milliliter vial with wet sediment and water was not recorded. Mass of wet sediment and mass of water in vial calculated as an average of all other incubations.
